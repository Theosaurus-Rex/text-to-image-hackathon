    <p class="text-2xl m-10 text-center">The DeepAI Image Generator was created using the <a href="ttps://deepai.org/machine-learning-model/text2img">text-to-image</a> model trained by 
        <a href="https://deepai.org/">DeepAI.org</a>. The model is able to take text inputs (formatted as a string) 
        and generates an original image based on existing images related to the input string. While some 
        prompts create terrifylingly accurate creations, others miss the mark substantially, suggesting 
        that the model needs further training with a wider variety of stimulus images.<br><br>
        This project was created in 48 hours for the Coder Academy Flex Track Hackathon, May 2021.</p>
